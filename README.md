## Structure of the code
I have used Tailwind CSS for styling and Firebase Authentication for Login Functionality. All images and logo is in the Assets folder. 

I have divided the contents into 3 sections, On the left is the 'ShippingInfo' then in the middle 'PaymentMethod' and in the right the 'Cart' section. All 3 sections are added into 'Context' component.
The name of the components are based on section name as described above.

## Login Functionality
A user can easily login or sign up by simply clicking on the button and a pop up will arraive and he can select his desired account to register.
